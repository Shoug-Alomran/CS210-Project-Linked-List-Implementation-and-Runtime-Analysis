# Appendix C — Runtime Output Screenshots

This appendix presents runtime screenshots captured during execution of the  
**CS210 Project — Student Course Registration Analysis**.

Each screenshot documents a specific stage of program execution,
from input validation to sorting performance benchmarking.

## :material-check-decagram-outline: Validation Summary

These screenshots confirm:

- Successful validation and loading of **3432 records**  
- Correct demand score computation  
- Accurate sorting using four algorithms  
- Reliable runtime measurement and benchmarking  

The results demonstrate correctness of implementation and consistency
between theoretical expectations and measured performance.
