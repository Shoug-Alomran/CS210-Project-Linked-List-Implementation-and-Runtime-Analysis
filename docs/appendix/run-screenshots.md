# Appendix C — Runtime Output Screenshots

---

## Overview

This appendix presents all runtime screenshots captured during the execution of the **CS210 Project — Student Course Registration Analysis**.  
Each image shows a specific stage in the program’s operation — from reading and validating input data to measuring sorting runtimes.

---

## 1. Full Run Validation
Displays the validation of input data and confirmation that 3432 registration records were successfully read.

---

## 2. Full Program Run
Shows the complete run of the program, including file reading, demand score calculation, writing results, and running all sorting algorithms.

## 3. Results Summary
Summarizes the measured runtime results of all sorting algorithms.

## 4. Reading and Writing Stage
Demonstrates the runtime for reading and writing data operations.

## Conclusion

These screenshots validate the correct implementation and execution of all program components, confirming:
- Accurate file reading and validation (3432 records)
- Correct computation of demand scores  
- Successful sorting using four algorithms  
- Accurate measurement of runtime performance
