# CS210 Project — Linked List Implementation & Runtime Analysis

Welcome to the documentation site for the **CS210 Project**, developed by  
**Shoug Alomran** and **Layan Bindayel**  
Under the supervision of **Dr. Najla Althuniyan**

This project evaluates how different sorting algorithms perform when applied
to real-world student registration data stored in a custom **Linked List**
structure.

## :material-view-dashboard-outline: Project Overview

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### :material-link-variant: Custom Data Structure

    Implementation of a fully functional **Linked List**
    to store and manage student registration records.

-   ### :material-calculator-variant-outline: Demand Scoring

    A weighted demand scoring system that evaluates
    registration priority using multiple factors.

-   ### :material-sort: Sorting Algorithms

    Implementation and comparison of:

    - Selection Sort  
    - Insertion Sort  
    - Merge Sort  
    - Quick Sort  

-   ### :material-timer-outline: Runtime Analysis

    Measurement and benchmarking of execution times
    to compare theoretical vs. practical performance.

## :material-target: Key Objectives

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   Build a fully functional program that reads,
    processes, and sorts real registration data.

-   Compare **theoretical complexity (Big-O)**
    with measured runtime performance.

-   Analyze how algorithm design impacts scalability.

-   Present clear, structured documentation
    for both implementation and analysis.

## :material-chart-line: Summary

This project integrates theoretical foundations with practical implementation.
It demonstrates how runtime analysis reflects algorithmic efficiency and
highlights the relationship between **Linked Lists**, **sorting algorithms**,
and **performance optimization** in computational problem-solving.
