# CS210 Project — Linked List Implementation and Runtime Analysis

Welcome to the documentation site for the **CS210 Project**, developed by **Shoug Alomran** and **Layan Bindayel** under the supervision of **Dr. Najla Althuniyan**.  
This project demonstrates how different sorting algorithms perform in practice when applied to real-world data stored in a **custom Linked List** structure.

---

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze student course registration data to determine **course demand** using efficient data structures and sorting algorithms.  
The implementation includes:

- Custom **Linked List** data structure.  

- **Demand scoring** system that evaluates registration priority.  

- Four sorting algorithms:

  - Selection Sort  

  - Insertion Sort  

  - Merge Sort  

  - Quick Sort  

- Runtime measurement and comparison across all algorithms.

---

## Key Objectives
- Build a fully functional program that reads, processes, and sorts real data.  
- Compare the **theoretical** and **measured** performance of four sorting algorithms.  
- Demonstrate how algorithmic design affects runtime efficiency.  
- Present clear, organized documentation that highlights both implementation and analysis.
