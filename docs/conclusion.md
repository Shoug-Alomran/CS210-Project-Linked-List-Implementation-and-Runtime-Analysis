# Conclusion

The results confirm that the implemented algorithms behaved as predicted
both theoretically and empirically.

Runtime measurements showed that:

- **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort** achieved the fastest execution times  
  due to their **O(n log n)** complexity.

- **Selection Sort** and **Insertion Sort** performed significantly slower,  
  consistent with their **O(n²)** time complexity.

The close alignment between theoretical analysis and measured results
demonstrates correctness of implementation and validity of benchmarking.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   ### :material-scale-balance: Simplicity vs. Efficiency

    Simple algorithms such as Selection Sort and Insertion Sort are
    easier to implement and understand but do not scale well.

-   ### :material-chart-line: Scalability Matters

    Advanced algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort, while more complex,
    provide significantly better performance for large datasets.

-   ### :material-flask-outline: Theory Meets Practice

    This project reinforced how theoretical complexity directly impacts
    measurable runtime in real-world scenarios.
